        <h2>Reporting</h2>

        <p>
          <span className="bold">
            If you are being harassed by a member of Mpls Jr Devs, notice that
            someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please
            contact our organizers at{' '}

          If the person who is harassing you is on the organizing team, they
          will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as
          promptly as we can.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="bold">
            This code of conduct applies to Mpls Jr Devs spaces, but if you are
            being harassed by a member of our community outside our spaces, we
            still want to know about it.
          </span>{' '}
          We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by our members,
          especially our organizers, seriously. This includes harassment outside
          our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The
          abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from Mpls Jr Devs
          based on their past behavior, including behavior outside our spaces
          and behavior towards people who are not a part of our community.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="bold">
            In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve
            the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad
            faith.
          </span>{' '}
          Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted
          without response.

            We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of
            protecting victims of abuse.
          </span>{' '}
          At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve
          received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about
          them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of our
          members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims
          without their affirmative consent.

        <h2>Consequences</h2>

        <p>
          <span className="bold">
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
            comply immediately.
          </span>{' '}
          If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Mpls Jr Devs
          organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and
          including expulsion from all Mpls Jr Devs spaces and identification of
          the participant as a harasser to other Mpls Jr Devs members or the
          general public.
